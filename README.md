# Chess
Project in TDT4100

Code is executed from [GameApp](https://github.com/ninzonthabeat/Chess/blob/main/src/main/java/Chess/GameApp.java).

The chess game is implemented by generating a [Game](https://github.com/ninzonthabeat/Chess/blob/main/src/main/java/Chess/Game.java) class, which initalizes the board with all the [Tile](https://github.com/ninzonthabeat/Chess/blob/main/src/main/java/Chess/Tile.java) objects. Each tile generates its [Piece](https://github.com/ninzonthabeat/Chess/blob/main/src/main/java/Chess/Piece.java)
